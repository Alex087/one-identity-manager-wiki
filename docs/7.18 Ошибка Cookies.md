> I guess you have your environment.ts pointing right to the apiserver.
> I've been able to solve it with these two alternatives:

- You can either modify your environment.ts to point to a local
  imxclient running apiserver. You'll need to set the /baseurl
  paramenter and define a web server with the
  <http://localhost:8182> url

- Or leave the environment.ts untouched, log to the
  apiserver-\>Administration Portal-\>log with an
  administrator-\>Configuration-\>APIServer-\>SameSite Cookie setting
  -\> None (this can be modified with a newer config setting, you'll see
  the option there.
