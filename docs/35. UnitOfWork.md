the UnitOfWork is treated as a transaction as in all or nothing. The
additional advantage of using a UnitOfWork is, that the object layer is
able to group the operations and can use bulk mode to write the data
into the database.

If you open a database on your own you are loosing the bulk
optimization.

The UnitOfWork implicitly opens a database transaction during the first
put operation.
